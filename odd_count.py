    - Look at the top of the range: if it is odd then add 1, if even leave alone.
    - Look at the bottom of the range: if it is odd then subtract 1, if even leave alone.
    - Take the difference between the new even top and bottom; then divide by two.
    So for the range [1,100] you get 100âˆ’02=50 odd integers.
